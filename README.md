## ðŸ’» PROJECT

The "Guess the number game" is an application that generates a random number between 0 to 10. The challenge of the game is trying to get which was the generated number in as few attempts as you can! 

Developing this project provided me the chance to test/ practice:
  * programming using variables, functions, if and else 
  * generating a random number (with JavaScript)
  * changing screens (with JavaScript)
  * avoiding form submission (with JavaScript)
  * getting the values of text input field (with JavaScript)
  * adding texts inside an element (with JavaScript)
